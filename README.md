## Calibration
### Gyro and Magnetometer
The gyro and magnetomoeter need to be calibrated before use.
To calibrate the gyro the IMU needs to remain motionless.
to calibrate the magnetometer the IMU needs to be rotated around as much as possible.
...try to not get them confused.

The calibration blocks give no indication of the status of the calibration process.
It's recommended to program the micro:bit to give feedback like this:
(TODO replace with screenshot of blocks)

|display X|

|calibrate gyro|

|display O|

|enable magnetometer|

|calibrate magnetometer|

|display :)|

|repeat forever|
